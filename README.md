# rotBright - rotation & brightness

#### Linux bash scripts to get display, brightness, touchscreen (and pen) in tune
Linux distributions tend to neglect thorough special key handling, brightness control, touchscreen and pen support,  
especially notebook, tablet and convertible users suffer from half-cooked, incorrect or missing implementation.

In many cases system devices are recognized correctly, so let's use what we got and try to mend it for daily use.

### download
download repository from GitHub,  
unzip and copy for example to: ~/rotBright

**or**

copy scripts to current directory  
`wget https://raw.github.com/qrti/rotBright/master/script/rotate.sh`  
`wget https://raw.github.com/qrti/rotBright/master/script/bright.sh`

**or**

check if git is installed  
`$ git --version`

if git is not installed  
`$ sudo apt-get install git-all`

clone shrink repository to current directory  
`$ git clone https://github.com/qrti/rotBright.git`

- - -

### configure
figure out your machines touch (and pen) device  
`$ xinput -list`

edit the script  
`$ nano rotate.sh`

if necessary replace preconfigured entries, for correct pen configuration see -> [remarks](#remarks)
```
DEVICE0="ELAN22A6:00 04F3:22A6"                     # Asus T102HA touchscreen
DEVICE1="ELAN22A6:00 04F3:22A6 Pen Pen (0)"         #             pen
DEVICE2="ASUS HID Device ASUS HID Device Touchpad"  #             touchpad
```

leave an entry empty to not configure a device
```
DEVICE0="YOUR_DEVICE:xx xxxx:xxxx"      # your touchscreen
DEVICE1=
```

display rotation possibly sets brightness to maximum, so it has to be restored as well  
executing rotate.sh will also call bright.sh and restore brightness if
```
RESTBRIGHT=true                         # restore brightness
```

- - -

### execute
change directory  
`$ cd ~/rotBright`

make scripts executable once  
`chmod a+x rotate.sh`  
`chmod a+x bright.sh`

execute rotation script  
`$ ./rotate.sh [+|normal|inverted|left|right|restore]`

|+   |normal |inverted |left |right | restore |       |
|----|-------|---------|-----|------|---------|-------|
|+90°|   0°  |   180°  | 90° | 270° |last used|current|

(counter clockwise)

execute brightness script  
`$ ./bright.sh [-|+|[10-100]|restore]`

|   -  |    +   | 10-100 | restore |       |
|------|--------|--------|---------|-------|
|darker|brighter|absolute|last used|current|

see [configure](#configure) to execute rotate.sh in combination with bright.sh

### keyboard shortcuts
for convenient use you can bind rotation and brightness control to keys,  
unfortunately on most laptops the special function key in combination with F1..F12 will not work,  
so try to figure out unused combinations with CTRL and/or ALT

example for brightness advance  
`preferences/keyboard/shortcuts/custom shortcuts/add custom shortcut`

```
name: Bright+
command: /home/USERNAME/rotBright/bright.sh +
key: CTRL-F6
```
replace USERNAME with your username

- - -

### auto restore
to automatically restore last used rotation and brightness at system start do the following

`preferences/startup applications/custom command`

```
name: Restore Rotation and Brightness 
command: /home/USERNAME/rotBright/rotate.sh restore
startup delay: 15
```
replace USERNAME with your username  
on fast systems startup delay can be reduced

### remarks
\- for correct pen restauration please consider

directly after boot a generic pen device will be listed with xinput  
`ELAN22A6:00 04F3:22A6 Pen`

after first pen use a device instance is added to the list  
`ELAN22A6:00 04F3:22A6 Pen Pen (0)`

use this instance in the script -> [configure](#configure)

\- restoring pen orientation after boot and first pen use requires a manual  
`$ ./rotate.sh restore`

\- developed under Linux Mint on Asus T102HA Mini Transformer with Visual Studio Code  
\- not tested on other machines but might work well on various notebooks, tablets and convertibles
